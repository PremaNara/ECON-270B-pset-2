This folder "WFH_Revised_Reproduction_Package" replicates everything in the paper "Does working from home work: evidence from a Chinese Experiment?"

The folder contains four sub-folders:
- Data: Contains all the data sets used to replicate the tables and figures in the paper
- Do: Contains the main do-file that creates all the tables and figures in the paper
- Fig: Contains all the figure-outputs produced by the do-file
- Tab: Does not contain any outputs in this version of the replication package. 

General notes:
- To run the code, set the directory to draw from the "data" folder
